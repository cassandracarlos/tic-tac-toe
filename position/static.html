          <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.</p>
          <div class="static" style="border: solid red; background-color:">This div element has position: static;</div>
          <p>position: static is useful when you want to reset an element’s positioning behavior to the default.</p>
          <p>It’s commonly used to override other positioning values like absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky when you need to return to the standard flow.</p>
